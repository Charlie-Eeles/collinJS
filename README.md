# collinJS
 
Collect and inject (collinJS) is a small package that is used to build a javascript function object that represents javascript helper functions in a folder structure.\
These functions are then intended to be injected into other functions through arguments.\
The idea is:

You can use it with:\
```npm install collinjs```
